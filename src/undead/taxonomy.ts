/**
 * We will classify types
 * 
 * Infantry
 * Missile Units
 * Cavalry
 * Caster
 * Siege
 * Hero
 * 
 * I guess a support unit may be in any of these categories
 * 
 * 3 Difficulty Tiers
 * 
 * My goal would be to have unique units for each tier of each category that a player may consider strategies against.
 * Which would mean players are invested into getting certain units. or upgrades?
 * I do like the stock system, it makes units even more valuable since there is a limited amount with a slow replenish time
