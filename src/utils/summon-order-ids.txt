There's a dummy channel spell called Build Basic that serves as the catalyst

can you just copy from any channel spell?

Base should be ANcl
Custom spell based on ANcl
there should be whole guides on the hive on using/abusing channel for map making purposes

would it be something like player casts this channel spell, use dummy caster to cast this summon?
ok

when a unit casts the channel spell then disable all the spells you dont want to be cast for triggering unit then order triggering unit to cast the summon
